Surrealist is a simple to use Browser and Desktop based query playground and database explorer for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/).

## How to use
You can [read our documentation](https://surrealist.starlane.studio/) for information on how to use Surrealist.

## Web App
You can use Surrealist by visiting https://surrealist.app/

While the web app provides a convenient and easy way to use Surrealist, the desktop app offers additional features such as an integrated database runner and offline support.

## Download
You can download the latest version of Surrealist Desktop from our [Releases](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/Surrealist/releases) page.

### Running on MacOS with versions v1.6.0 or newer
Running Surrealist on MacOS is more complicated than on its Windows and Linux counterparts because our application is not signed. To run Surrealist on MacOS, please do the following:
- Navigate to your desired release (v1.6.0 and newer)
- Download the `surrealist-<version>-darwin.dmg` release file
- Open the executable
- When prompted, drag the Surrealist application into the "Applications" directory
- Navigate to your Applications directory
- Right-click on the Surrealist application and cick on open (Note: It is important to use right-click because for some reason left clicking to open does not work the first two times you run Surrealist)
- You will receive a prompt that says "Surrealist cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." Click on cancel
- Right-click on the Surrealist application and click on open again. This time you should receive a different prompt with an "Open" option. Click on open
- Surrealist should now launch, and you should now be able to launch Surrealist without issue from the Launchpad.

### Running on MacOS with versions prior to v1.6.0
We recommend that you use the latest Surrealist release. However, if you need to run an older release of Surrealist prior to version v1.6.0, follow these steps:
- Navigate to your desired release (any release prior to v1.6.0)
- Download the appropriate release file (select the arm64 for M1 and newer Macs and amd64 for Macs prior to M1)
- Extract the application from the tgz file
- Move the Surrealist executable to your Applications directory
- Delete the tgz file, as it is no-longer needed
- Open the Terminal app and navigate to the Applications directory by typing `cd /Applications`
- Run the command `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine Surrealist.app` (You may be prompted to enter your password)
- You should now be able to run Surrealist as normal from the Launchpad

If the steps for either of these MacOS processes do not work, please do not hesitate to open an issue.

## Local database
You can start a local database directly from the application by pressing the start button in the top right. Doing so will start up a SurrealDB instance using the credentials and port entered for the current tab.

You can choose whether the local database is stored in memory or stored on disk on the Settings screen.

This functionality is currently only available in the desktop app.

## Query view
Use the Query View to execute queries against your database. You can define variables in the Variables panel and use them in your queries, and browse the results in the Results panel.

Executed queries are saved to the Query History or can be manually saved to the Favorites panel to quickly access previous queries.

## Explorer view
The Explorer View is used to browse your database and inspect individual records. When you select a table in the left panel, the table contents will be displayed in the Record Explorer. You can click on a record id to open the Record Inspector, in which you can edit the record contents and traverse graph relationships.
